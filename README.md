This project is a Google Sheets workbook that analyzes data from a language center called "Aprendé Hablando". The workbook contains information on 1,000 students, including their names, email addresses, and grades. It calculates students' final grades based on their scores on two partial exams and a final project. It also tracks students' achievements, such as honors and discounts. Additionally, the workbook includes various charts and graphs that help visualize the data.
